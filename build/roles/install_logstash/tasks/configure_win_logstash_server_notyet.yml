### The task after this one is not idempotent. This check changes that.
### Check whether an SSL cert already exists and store the result.
- name: check if certs exist already
  stat:
    path: "{{ansible_ssl_certificate_folder}}/logstash-forwarder.crt"
  register: logstash_cert

### Create an SSL certificate if one doesnt already exist.
### the only real possible variable in the command is the
### subject name. However it is recommended to leave it as "ELK".
### multiname subject names (e.g elk.example.com) are NOT supported
### and will break filebeats ability to talk to logstash.
### If you do change ELK to some other word, update the client install
### script to reflect the new name (in the host file edit task)
- name: generate OpenSSL certificate
  delegate_to: localhost
  command: "openssl req -subj '/CN=ELK/' -x509 -days 3650 -batch -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout {{ansible_ssl_key_folder}}/private/logstash-forwarder.key -out {{ansible_ssl_certificate_folder}}/logstash-forwarder.crt"
  args:
    creates: "{{ansible_ssl_certificate_folder}}/logstash-forwarder.crt"
  when: not logstash_cert.stat.exists

### We push the SSL cert and key to Logstash server
### This is because we will push it out to all clients later
### and having it stored locally makes that push easier.
### It also means the ansible machine is one step closer to
### being set up for log gathering if thats your thing.
