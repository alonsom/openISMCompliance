# This is the main variable default definition file for this role.
# It defines all the default variable values that will be provided to plays that
# use this role and it references other default variable definition files as
# required.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: These default role variable definitions have LOWER precedence
# than all variables defined in playbooks and inventories. If a role variable
# definition should have HIGHER precedence than this then it should be placed
# into the role vars (instead of the role defaults).
